### Listing all tasks: `list`

Shows every task currently in your list, along with its type, completion status, and any dates.

Example: `list`

```
=================================================
1.[T][X] read book
2.[D][ ] return book (by: Dec 2 2019)
3.[E][ ] project meeting (from: Aug 06 2026 to: Aug 06 2026)
=================================================
```

### Adding a todo: `todo`

Adds a simple task with no date attached.

Example: `todo read book`

```
=================================================
Got it. I've added this task:
  [T][ ] read book
Now you have 1 task in the list.
=================================================
```

### Adding a deadline: `deadline`

Adds a task that must be completed by a specific date.

Example: `deadline return book /by 2019-12-02`

```
=================================================
Got it. I've added this task:
  [D][ ] return book (by: Dec 2 2019)
Now you have 2 tasks in the list.
=================================================
```

### Adding an event: `event`

Adds a task that spans a start and end date.

Example: `event project meeting /from 2026-08-06 /to 2026-08-06`

```
=================================================
Got it. I've added this task:
  [E][ ] project meeting (from: Aug 6 2026 to: Aug 6 2026)
Now you have 3 tasks in the list.
=================================================
```

### Marking a task as done: `mark`

Marks the specified task as completed.

Example: `mark 1`

```
=================================================
Nice! I've marked this task as done:
[T][X] read book
=================================================
```

### Unmarking a task: `unmark`

Marks the specified task as not yet completed.

Example: `unmark 1`

```
=================================================
OK, I've marked this task as not done yet:
[T][ ] read book
=================================================
```

### Deleting a task: `delete`

Removes the specified task from your list permanently.

Example: `delete 2`

```
=================================================
Noted. I've removed this task:
  [D][ ] return book (by: Dec 2 2019)
Now you have 2 tasks in the list.
=================================================
```

### Finding tasks: `find`

Searches your task list for descriptions containing the given keyword.

Example: `find book`

```
=================================================
Here are the matching tasks in your list:
1. [T][X] read book
=================================================
```

### Exiting the program: `bye`

Ends the session and closes Clanky.

Example: `bye`

```
=================================================
Bye. Hope to see you again soon!
=================================================
```

### Saving and loading data

Clanky automatically saves your tasks to disk after every change, and loads them back the next time you start the program — no manual save command needed. Data is stored in a hidden folder in your home directory, so it works consistently no matter where you run Clanky from.
